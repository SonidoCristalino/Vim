# Information about this repository

This repository is about config files for [vim](https://www.vim.org/) text editor.

## How can you use this config files?

1. Please, first install [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
2. **IMPORTANT:** clone this repository into your `$HOME` and after that change the dir name from
   `Vim` to `.vim`. 
3. The final path to assume the new configuration must be `$HOME/.vim`, because from this directory vim will
   take all the config. 
4. If you already have your file configuration like `$HOME/.vimrc` please, change it name, just
   like `vimrc_bkp`.
5. Enjoy it!
